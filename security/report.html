<h1>ScoreCenter Assessment</h1> 
<h2>Introduction</h2><hr/>
<p>The ScoreCenter Application provides a way for online HTML and HTML5 games to send 
scores and get scores from an outside database. The ScoreCenter holds data from multiple
games, and any website can send GET and POST requests to the application, as CORS is 
enabled.</p>
<p>We were hired to assess the security of this application, determining pertinent security
risks and providing suggestions to fix them.</p><hr/> 
<h2>Methodology</h2><hr/>
<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2><hr/>
<h2>Issues Found</h2><hr/>
	<h3>Issue 3: Score/User Validation</h3>
	<ul><li>Location: /submit.json</li>
		<li>Severity of issue: MEDIUM. Any user can send any score (truthful or fabricated)
		to the Score Center, which delegitimizes the web application. If another website
		uses the Score Center's GET API, they are expecting the top 10 scores that were
		actually achieved on the requested game. </li>
		<li>Description of issue: Currently, any user anywhere can submit a POST request
		to the Score Center; the request does not even necessarily have to be from the same
		game. Note the screen shot below.</li>
		<img src="frog1.png" width="500" height="450" alt="frog1"/><br/> 
</li>Here, I simply wrote a POST request into my frogger
		game and gave myself an incredible score. But, note the actual games that sent the
		request from: <br/>
		<img src="game1.png" width="500" height="450" alt="game1"/>
		<img src="game2.png" width="500" height="450" alt="game2"/><br/>
		I got downwards of 400 points! However, on the Score Center, my made-up score is recorded:</li>
		<img src="score1.png" width="500" height="450" alt="score1"/><br/>
		That same made up score was sent for both games, and if I wanted to, I could even
		fabricate the name of the game I was sending the information from. 
		<li>Resolution: In order to be a truly legitimate recorder of high scores for online
		games, the Score Center app needs to have user validation. Before being able to input
		a score, you must be validated as a user that has administrative rights over the game, 
		preventing random people from sending (1) bogus scores and (2) bogus scores for made-up
		games.</li>
	</ul> 
	<h3>Issue 2: Input Validation; Length of input</h3> 
		<ul><li>Location: /submit.json</li>
		<li>Severity of issue: HIGH. There is no limit on the amount of data a user can send
		to the Score Center as a post request. It is, therefore, possible to send massive amounts
		of data to the Score Center, resulting in both faulty data and a potential clogging of 
		MongoDB.</li>
		<li>Description of issue: To test this, I concatenated about 113680 lines of a
		dictionary into a single string and sent it as a username several times: <br/>
		<img src="words1.png" width="350" height="350" alt="words1"/></br/></li> 
		Then, I concatenated more lines of the dictionary and added that to one previous, sending
		it as a username several times: <br/>
		<img src="load2.png" width="350" height="350" alt="load2"/></br> 
		This severely slowed the loading of the page. After leaving the page and returning, it took
		nearly 15 seconds to load: 
		<img src="load1.png" width="350" height="350" alt="load1"/>
		<li>Resolution: Limit the size of the input you are receiving. The size needs to be limited
		for both the username field and the score field. While web browsers limit the size of the string
		in the alert box, this can be bypassed, through the means demonstrated above.</li>
	</ul> 
	<h3>Issue 1: Cross-Site Scripting</h3> 
		<ul><li>Location: /submit.json</li>
		<li>Severity of issue: HIGH. Through the post request, it is possible to pass in a script
		that will affect all of the users. This is an enormous problem, as it completely 
		eliminates the usefulness and security of the site. </li>
		<li>Description of issue: It is possible to insert a script into the score field and 
		send it to submit.json. Since this script is a field that is repeatedly printed onto
		the screen, every time the page is loaded, each script that is sent is executed. First,
		I did a simply alert tag, resulting in this: Then, I created popup windows and
		replaced the website with another. Note that both of these actions occur every time
		regardless of what I, or anyone else, submits to the ScoreCenter. </li>
		<li>Resolution: Validate the input that is received and reject it if it is not 
		exactly what is requested (a number, a string with no tags, etc).</li>
	</ul> 
</ul>
