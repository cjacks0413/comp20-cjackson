<h1>ScoreCenter Assessment</h1> 
<h2>Introduction</h2><hr/>
<p>The ScoreCenter Application provides a way for online HTML and HTML5 games to send 
scores and get scores from an outside database. The ScoreCenter holds data from multiple
games, and any website can send GET and POST requests to the application, as CORS is 
enabled.</p>
<p>We were hired to assess the security of this application, determining pertinent security
risks and providing suggestions to fix them.</p><hr/> 
<h2>Methodology</h2><hr/>
<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2><hr/>
<h2>Issues Found</h2><hr/>
	<h3>Issue 1: Score/User Validation</h3>
	<ul><li>Location: /submit.json</li>
		<li>Severity of issue: MEDIUM. Any user can send any score (truthful or fabricated)
		to the Score Center, which delegitimizes the web application. If another website
		uses the Score Center's GET API, they are expecting the top 10 scores that were
		actually achieved on the requested game. </li>
		<li>Description of issue: Currently, any user anywhere can submit a POST request
		to the Score Center; the request does not even necessarily have to be from the same
		game. Note the screen shot below.</li>
		<img src="frog1.png" width="500" height="450" alt="frog1"/><br/> 
</li>Here, I simply wrote a POST request into my frogger
		game and gave myself an incredible score. But, note the actual games that sent the
		request from: <br/>
		<img src="game1.png" id="game" width="500" height="450" alt="game1"/>
		<img src="game2.png" width="500" height="450" alt="game2"/><br/>
		I got downwards of 400 points! However, on the Score Center, my made-up score is recorded:</li>
		<img src="score1.png" width="500" height="450" alt="score1"/><br/>
		That same made up score was sent for both games, and if I wanted to, I could even
		fabricate the name of the game I was sending the information from. 
		<li>Resolution: In order to be a truly legitimate recorder of high scores for online
		games, the Score Center app needs to have user validation. Before being able to input
		a score, you must be validated as a user that has administrative rights over the game, 
		preventing random people from sending (1) bogus scores and (2) bogus scores for made-up
		games.</li>
	</ul>
