<h1>ScoreCenter Assessment</h1> 
<h2>Introduction</h2><hr/>
<p>The ScoreCenter Application provides a way for online HTML and HTML5 games to send 
scores and get scores from an outside database. The ScoreCenter holds data from multiple
games, and any website can send GET and POST requests to the application, as CORS is 
enabled.</p>
<p>We were hired to assess the security of this application, determining pertinent security
risks and providing suggestions to fix them.</p><hr/> 
<h2>Methodology</h2><hr/><p>I reviewed the source code for the web application, Score Center.To test the application,
I first attempting to send a normal POST request. Then, I examined the ways in which I could
still fit into the categories designated, while not providing the expected data, noting
weaknesses. I then tested these perceived weaknesses, the results of which can be found below.
</p>
<p> Tools: I used Firefox'sTamper Data to check the status of requests.</p> 
<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2><hr/>
<p>There are several security risks present in the Score Center application, all of which stem
from a lack of Input Validation.
	<ul>
		<li>It is possible to send any length of string or number into the POST Request. Therefore,
		massive amounts of data can be sent to the web application, slowing down the page and
		clogging up the database.</li>
		<li>It is possible to add a script to the POST Request, resulting in the execution
		of javascript scripts that are seen by all users of the website.</li>
		<li>It is possible to send whatever information one desires, regardless of the 
		score received, username inputted, or game being played. This delegitimizes the information
		stored in the application.</li>
	</ul></p> 
<h2>Issues Found</h2><hr/>

	<h3>Issue 1: Input Validation; Length of input</h3> 
		<ul><li>Location: /submit.json</li>
		<li>Severity of issue: HIGH. There is no limit on the amount of data a user can send
		to the Score Center as a post request. It is, therefore, possible to send massive amounts
		of data to the Score Center, resulting in both faulty data and a potential clogging of 
		MongoDB.</li>
		<li>Description of issue: To test this, I concatenated about 113680 lines of a
		dictionary into a single string and sent it as a username several times: <br/>
		<img src="words1.png" width="350" height="350" alt="words1"/></br/></li> 
		Then, I concatenated more lines of the dictionary and added that to one previous, sending
		it as a username several times: <br/>
		<img src="load2.png" width="350" height="350" alt="load2"/></br> 
		This severely slowed the loading of the page. After leaving the page and returning, it took
		nearly 15 seconds to load: 
		<img src="load1.png" width="350" height="350" alt="load1"/>
		<li>Resolution: Limit the size of the input you are receiving. The size needs to be limited
		for both the username field and the score field. While web browsers limit the size of the string
		in the alert box, this can be bypassed, through the means demonstrated above.</li>
	</ul> 
	<h3>Issue 2: Cross-Site Scripting</h3> 
		<ul><li>Location: /submit.json</li>
		<li>Severity of issue: HIGH. Through the post request, it is possible to pass in a script
		that will affect all of the users. This is an enormous problem, as it completely 
		eliminates the usefulness and security of the site. </li>
		<li>Description of issue: It is possible to insert a script into the score field and 
		send it to submit.json. Since this script is a field that is repeatedly printed onto
		the screen, every time the page is loaded, each script that is sent is executed. First,
		I did a simply alert tag, resulting in this: <br/>
		<img src="alert1.png" width="350" height="350" alt="alert1"/><br/>
		Then, I created popup windowsand replaced the website with another: <br/>
		<img src="crossside1.png" width="350" height="350" alt="cross11"/><br/>
		Which resulted in this: <br/>
		<img src="popups1.png" width="350" height="350" alt="popups1"/>
		<img src="replace1.png" width="350" height="350" alt="replace1"/><br/> 
 		Note that both of these actions occur every time regardless of what I, or anyone else, submit to the ScoreCenter. </li>
		<li>Resolution: Validate the input that is received and reject it if it is not 
		exactly what is requested (a number, a string with no tags, etc).</li>
	</ul> 
	<h3>Issue 3: Score/User Validation</h3>
	<ul><li>Location: /submit.json</li>
		<li>Severity of issue: MEDIUM. Any user can send any score (truthful or fabricated)
		to the Score Center, which delegitimizes the web application. If another website
		uses the Score Center's GET API, they are expecting the top 10 scores that were
		actually achieved on the requested game. </li>
		<li>Description of issue: Currently, any user anywhere can submit a POST request
		to the Score Center; the request does not even necessarily have to be from the same
		game. Note the screen shot below.</li>
		<img src="frog1.png" width="500" height="450" alt="frog1"/><br/> 
</li>Here, I simply wrote a POST request into my frogger
		game and gave myself an incredible score. But, note the actual games that sent the
		request from: <br/>
		<img src="game1.png" width="500" height="450" alt="game1"/>
		<img src="game2.png" width="500" height="450" alt="game2"/><br/>
		I got downwards of 400 points! However, on the Score Center, my made-up score is recorded:</li>
		<img src="score1.png" width="500" height="450" alt="score1"/><br/>
		That same made up score was sent for both games, and if I wanted to, I could even
		fabricate the name of the game I was sending the information from. 
		<li>Resolution: In order to be a truly legitimate recorder of high scores for online
		games, the Score Center app needs to have user validation. Before being able to input
		a score, you must be validated as a user that has administrative rights over the game, 
		preventing random people from sending (1) bogus scores and (2) bogus scores for made-up
		games.</li>
	</ul> 

</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><hr/> 
<p>The weakest link in this web application is clearly /submit.json. There are numerous
security risks that all boil down to a lack of input validation. At minimal cost of 50 dollars,
we will be able to make your website more secure against attacks such as the ones demonstrated
above. In future web applications, consider adding more processing of POSt request on
the server-side. </p>
