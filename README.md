1. What is Comp20?
	Web Programming Course at Tufts University, focus on HTML5/CSS, Javascript, Web Security, etc.
	There is a focus on breadth, not depth, and the course covers a variety of topics.
2. Favorite project
    My favorite project was the score center because it was the first project in which we 
    did something completely new. Server-side programming is complicated, but interesting, 
    and it's something that we would not otherwise get a lot of experience doing. The group
    project, also related to sever-side programming, is a great way to work in groups and
    do a type of project not necessarily found in the TuftsCS program.
3. Project/lab most proud of
	I am most proud of the score center project, regardless of grade, because it's the one
	I spent the most time understanding how to do. 
4. Personal Growth 
	I think the area I have grown the most in throughout this class concerns revision control.
	For the first few weeks of class, I struggled (along with most others) with figuring out Git 
	and Github. But now, I am much more comfortable with it and I feel like I can definitely apply
	my knowledge of it to other areas. On a broader scale, I think that in the class I have 
	learned more about programming outside of the classroom. By using things like Git and
	Heroku and other non-explicit TuftsCS things, I have a greater ability to apply what I've
	learned to other areas.
